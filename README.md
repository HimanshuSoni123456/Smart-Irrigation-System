# Smart-Irrigation-System
This is my first project related to sensors
           Here is some basic highlights of our project:-
1)Basically, the project is based on the smart irrigation system and the soil moisture sensor.
2) Soil sensor measure the inpute capacitance of the soil and converts into the analog voltage.this analog voltage goes to the aurdino UNO and converts into the digital.
3)Digital voltage is showed in the 16×2 display. 
4)The rate of evapouration increase the moisture content will decrease in soil as our potential will increase. from this potential we can calculate the humidity percentage at that in the soil.
5) According to this particular benchmark water pump will automatically on and increase the moisture content. (like:- if we set 72% moisture content then when water reaches to 72% then water pump will automatically turned OFF if water content less then 72% then water level will automatically turned ON).
I hope you get idea about our project.
Here are some references and items we used:-
1) Aurdino UNO(1)
2) 16×2 lcd display(1)
3) 5v Relay module (1)
4) Soil moisture sensor (×3)
5) DC water pump 
6) Jumper wires and bread board
